Several goals for this homework:
* You will become a master of JPA annotations
* JPA for Spring won't have secrets for you anymore
* Spring Data JPA magic
* Handle a layered conception

We will print, in a web page, the content of a DB.

## DB Initialization
* Create a new schema named `yncrea_lab03`
* We assume that your DB credentials are `root:root`

## TODO's
Just read the provided code and replace the TODO's with your implementation.
